elite-prism-ctl
--------

a simple tool to configure the SteelSeries Elite Prism Headset on Linux

installation
--------

this project depends on the following python libraries:

    appindicator gtk pyudev webcolors yaml

for example, on Ubuntu, you would have to install the following packages:

    sudo apt-get install python-appindicator python-gtk2 python-pyudev python-webcolors python-yaml

get the code:

    git clone https://github.com/mimfgg/elite-prism-ctl.git
    cd elite-prism-ctl

by default, your user cannot write to the device of your soundcard because of restrictive permissions, we need to add this kernel rule:

    sudo cp xx-elite-prism.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/94-elite-prism.rules
    sudo restart udev

unplug/replug your prism soundcard if it was already plugged in, then start as an indicator with:

    python ./elite-prism-ctl.py --as-indicator
